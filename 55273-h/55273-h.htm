<h2>American Missionary Association.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By the time this number of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> reaches our
readers our Annual Report for 1880 will be through the press. We
shall be happy to forward it to any of our friends who will send us
their name and address, signifying their desire to have it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This number of the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> contains a complete
list of the names of the persons appointed for the current year to
the different fields where this Association carries on its work at
home and abroad. We commend the work and the workers to the great
Lord of the harvest, and to all those who utter the prayer He has
taught us to offer, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, in earth,
as it is in heaven.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is the belief of this Association that conversion is the proper
door into the kingdom of science, as well as to the kingdom of
Heaven. Our teachers and pastors, therefore, seek to bring those
who come under their instruction to a knowledge of the truth as it
is in Jesus, in order that they may be qualified to know aright
and properly appropriate all knowledge. We are glad, therefore, to
be able to refer our readers to letters from the field, in this
number, as evidence that revival work is going on at different
points throughout the South.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letters from our various stations at the South remind us, as we
would remind our friends, that this winter is a hard one for the
colored people, and that our missionaries really need more money
and more clothing to distribute than in ordinary winters. We quote
from one letter, which must serve for all: “As I write, the ground
is covered with snow to the depth of about six inches, the first
we have seen since 1876. By reason of the unprepared condition of
the poor people here, living in open shanties and scantily supplied
with clothing and food, this season of excessive cold is especially

<p>We are glad to know that the Rev. A. D. Mayo, one of the editors
of the <cite>Journal of Education</cite>, is making an extended tour of the
South, and will hold Teachers’ Institutes and deliver courses of
lectures in its chief educational centres. We shall await with
great interest the report of what he sees and learns during his
visit, and expect valuable suggestions from one who, to his wide
experience as an educator shall add an accurate knowledge of the
present condition of that part of the country.</p>

<p>At the Annual Meeting in Norwich, the Committee on foreign work
recommended that a superintendent of African missions be secured
at once. The Executive Committee, after careful inquiry, made
selection of Rev. H. M. Ladd, a much beloved pastor of Walton, N.
Y., who has written:</p>

<p>“I hereby accept the position, praying the Great Head of the church
for His blessing upon the arduous work undertaken in His name,
looking for His help, without which we can do nothing, but with
which we can do all things. I shall endeavor to enter upon the work
of the Association on the 1st of February.”</p>

<p>We sympathize with his people in their great loss and congratulate
them on the valuable gift they make to the cause of the Master.</p>

<p><cite>The Southern Workman</cite>, published at Hampton, Va., is,
mechanically, a fair and most creditable specimen of the work done
in the industrial department of the Hampton school; its editorial
management proves that men good for something else are devoting
their talents to negro education, while its columns show that
intelligent minds giving promise of future usefulness are being
trained in the school, and the paper, as a whole, gives an adequate
idea of the work being done and yet to be done in such schools. Our
friends who would at once have a very readable paper, keep informed
on all phases of the Hampton work, and contribute something to
support a most worthy enterprise, can do all this by sending to
Gen. Armstrong the price of the <cite>Southern Workman</cite>.</p>

<h3>VALUE OF DR. TANNER’S EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>This is not to be found in the fact that after all a man must eat
or die; this we more than suspected before the Doctor’s experiment;
neither has he settled how long a man may do without food; but he
has shown conclusively that starvation, as a mode of living, is not
economical, and that a life thus sustained is not worth anything.
It cost a great deal to keep him alive, and the utmost he could do
was to be driven out for a daily airing.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></p>

<p>This lesson constitutes the sole value of his elaborate and painful
experiment: A man who is to do anything must be properly nourished;
plenty of good, wholesome food is cheaper than a diet of ice-water.</p>

<p>Good friends, we need not repeat the Doctor’s experiment to prove
that the policy of starvation is a mistaken policy, and is every
way expensive and hurtful. The question is not how long can a life
be sustained at the point of starvation, which is also the point of
utter worthlessness, but how much can a life properly nourished be
made to accomplish?</p>

<p>Our parable needs no explanation. Three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is the least sum that should be named as at all adequate to
the highest efficiency of our school and church work. We can <em>live</em>
on less, but by so much as we fall short of this by so much are we
hampered and crippled.</p>

<p>The work we have to do is a work that must be done, and we, the
churches of the country, have it to do. It becomes, of course, a
question of wise economy in the expenditure of means. We point
again to the lesson taught us and reiterate it: Starvation is not
economy! The condition of greatest efficiency is that of abundant
life blood; and for the work of the A. M. A. for 1881, this means
at least three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<h3>FREEMASONRY.</h3>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> for October, 1880, an item appeared,
copied mainly from an Atlanta paper, giving some statistics in
regard to the colored people of that city. It named the amount of
their taxable property, their industrial pursuits, and benevolent
and charitable institutions&mdash;the Odd Fellows and Masonic lodges
being mentioned among the number. Of all these institutions the
article quoted said that they have encouraged the people “to form
habits of sobriety and economy, and imbued them with feelings of
charity and benevolence.”</p>

<p>It has been thought by some of our friends that quoting this
remark was an endorsement by us of Masonry and Odd Fellowship. We
wish explicitly to deny the correctness of such an inference. The
executive officers of this Association have no sympathy with secret
oath-bound Societies, and the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, on fitting
occasions, has spoken plainly on the subject. Thus in 1873, the
present Secretary of the Association wrote, and, with the hearty
concurrence of his fellow-officers, published, in the August number
of that year, the following article:</p>

<p>“Attention has been called anew to this subject, by the refusal of
an ecclesiastical council at the West to ordain a young man to the
ministry, for what was regarded as a too tenacious adhesion to the
Lodge. Of the merits of that case we are not well enough informed
to pronounce a judgment, but it is clear to us that the growth
and power of Masonry is no light matter. The principle of secret
organization is unsuitable to a Republican government, and contrary
to the open spirit of Christianity. Among the colored people the
prevalence of Masonry would be a great evil&mdash;involving a waste of
time and an expenditure of money they are little able to bear, as
well as exposing them to undue political influences, and diverting
their attention from an intelligent and pure Christianity&mdash;their
only hope. Our teachers and ministers at the South already see
these effects beginning to appear, and deprecate them.”</p>

<p>Nothing has occurred since that time to modify, except to
intensify, these convictions, and the attitude and influence of our
schools and churches in the South have been wholly and decidedly
opposed to these secret societies, as many facts, if necessary,
would testify.</p>

<h3>NATIONAL EDUCATION&mdash;PREPARATION FOR IT.</h3>

<p>In connection with the educational bill, which passed the Senate
last week, a word concerning the American Missionary Association.
Are we to have a national uprising of popular sentiment and
legislative action with reference to the education of all peoples
within our borders, but especially in the South? How signally, in
the providence of God, did this Association forecast the need, and
how wonderfully has it, these years past, been preparing the way.
If it had done no more, it has proved to all the world, past all
cavil, this&mdash;the cultivability of the negro, the practicability of
education for the poor blacks and also for the “poor whites” of the
South. Its Christian schools of all grades, planted here and there
in all the States, have led the way and established beginnings
of the utmost importance. These schools, by the sheer force of
their own excellence, and results so signal as to arrest universal
attention, have lived down the most desperate prejudices, and
commanded the most emphatic testimonials from all classes and from
those highest in authority. Never has a grand Christian enterprise
shown itself more certain of good results; never did a benevolent
undertaking more remarkably manifest its self-perpetuating,
self-propagating force. It has given a new complexion to the entire
“negro problem” in this country. It has successfully asserted the
right of the lowliest of all citizens to share in the benefits
and advantages of education. The Association, by the largeness of
its plans, the boldness of its project, the manifestation on the
spot of its work, by its public advocacy throughout the North, has
served to press constantly upon the public attention the exact
nature of the great emergency in the field of popular education.
When were ever before the wisdom of a measureless benevolence and
the audacity of a glorious faith more manifestly justified in their
results?</p>

<p>But will not the new Congressional scheme for promoting popular
education in the States of the South, render somewhat less urgent
the work and the claim of the American Missionary Association? By
no means! Just the reverse is true. Money alone will not educate
anybody. If the first need be that of more money, at least the
second necessity will be that of <em>suitable teachers</em>. Precisely
here, to meet this necessity, is seen the almost prophetic,
certainly the providential, anticipatory work of the Association,
getting things ready for the great stroke of truly national
statesmanship now proposed.</p>

<p>To say that the American Missionary Association <em>should</em> have, at
once, placed at its disposal five times its present resources to
meet the new exigency, would be to make a statement altogether
temperate, considerate and reasonable. The opportunity is one that
is transcendently inviting.&mdash;<cite>Rev. S. Gilbert in The Advance.</cite></p>

<h3>THE APPEAL OF THE EXODUS.</h3>

<p>We have kept a close watch upon this strange inter-State
migration, the causes of which will make a blushing page in the
history of our country. Its sad story should be a strong appeal to
all who have a heart to feel for the wrongs and sufferings of the
helpless.</p>

<p>After many urgent solicitations, and repeated investigations, we
felt, despite all hindrances from lack of funds, that the time
had fully come for action, when we were informed that the General
Association of Kansas had appointed its Superintendent of Home
Missions, the President of its College and others, a Committee, to
confer with us in regard to this work.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Secretary and the Field Superintendent went up
from the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a> National Council to consult with this Committee and
inaugurate such a movement as might seem best.</p>

<p>At Topeka, which has a large colored population, were found the
General Committee of Relief, and a committee of Refugees, whose
duty it is to take charge of arrivals, departures, etc., and watch
the subsequent course of these people. It was decided to purchase
lots in Tennessee Town, a suburb of this city, and erect a house
at a cost of $1,000, under the superintendence of our old, tried
worker, Rev. R. F. Markham, and we are glad to announce that,
despite the cold weather, it is nearly ready for occupancy.</p>

<p>This is to be the home of our night school for adults under charge
of Mr. and Mrs. White, of Oberlin. The pupils of this school
are excluded from the public schools because of their age, and
because they are necessarily occupied through the day. In it also
will be sheltered the vigorous mission Sunday-school which Pastor
Blakesley’s church has sustained, and which will be under charge
of Mr. A. J. De Hart, a young colored man from Washburn College,
recently ordained by a council at Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>We have also located one of our Southern colored preachers&mdash;a young
man&mdash;in the Second Congregational Church of Lawrence, where there
is also a large colored population. Other points on this frontier
of colored population will be kept in view.</p>

<p>Of the $2,500 which this work will cost for the year the citizens
of Topeka have raised $700, and we have on hand a Kansas fund of
$450. This leaves still $1,350 to be raised as a special sum, as
this work is not provided for in the regular appropriations for the
year.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee, urged as it has been, both by our friends
and by the pressing need of this much abused and suffering people,
has ventured on this expenditure, confident that it is a duty which
must not be neglected, also that our friends will meet the exigency
by sending in promptly the amount needed.</p>

<p>“These children of the dispersion,” peeled and torn, stretch
out their hands to us again! Shall we not hear in their cry the
pleadings of the Saviour for these, the weakest of his suffering
children, and account this extra gift as but a small portion of the
double recompense due them for their redoubled wrongs?</p>

<h3>NOVEMBER REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. J. E. ROY, D. D.</p>

<p>On the day after the election, I left my home at Atlanta to attend
in Memphis the Central South Conference and the Council for the
installation of a pastor, Mr. B. A. Imes, of Oberlin Seminary.
In the Conference I drew up the memorial which was presented to
the National Council in behalf of a re-statement of our Creed and
Catechism, urging the peculiar need of our Southern work, and
preached on the Lord’s day, once in our Second church and once in
the Second Presbyterian, lately that of Dr. Boggs. As moderator
of the installing council, I led in the examination and delivered
the charge to the people. Both bodies I reported daily in the
<cite>Memphis Appeal</cite>; wrote them up in a “Pilgrim” letter to the
<cite>Congregationalist</cite>, and gave their items to the <cite>Advance</cite> and
<cite>Christian Union</cite>.</p>

<p>As a delegate from Georgia in the National Council at St. Louis,
your field superintendent nominated as assistant moderator Rev.
J. D. Smith (colored), of Alabama, who was elected on the first
ballot, and secured the appointment of Rev. Drs. Sturtevant and
Goodell to offer fellowship to the Presbyterian General Assembly
South, hoping for some incidental benefit to our work.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></p>

<p>At Dr. Strieby’s request I went on with him to Kansas for the
purpose of initiating our Refugee mission, for which a lot was
bought and a house contracted for at Topeka.</p>

<p>Thence I went down to Paris, in Texas, to assist in the ordination
of two of our Talladega men, J. W. Roberts as pastor in that city,
and J. W. Strong to take the pastorate in Corpus Christi. Spending
five days there, I preached for our church in Paris, also for
the white Congregational church which I had organized six years
ago, planned for a new church site and building, and visited and
preached for our country church at Pattonville, twelve miles out,
arranging for the supply of this and two other little churches by
local preachers.</p>

<p>At Little Rock, Ark., I explored and found the fit material for a
Congregational church to be organized as soon as we can have the
money. In time we must have for Arkansas one of our first-class
institutions at this beautiful capital, which has seven or eight
thousand colored people, and which is the centre of a large
population of Freedmen.</p>

<p>In three days, at Tougaloo, I inspected the Institution; counselled
with the managers as to building schemes; lectured on “How to make
money,&mdash;by labor, economy, education, investment;” and delivered
a missionary address and a sermon, being permitted to rejoice
that day with the teacher in the conversion of one of their most
interesting young men.</p>

<p>The tour, which was one of 2,804 miles, occupied a month. The cost
of travel was $88.15, unusually large, even for so long a trip, as
I had to use the two great roads leading to Texas, which decline
the usual ministerial courtesies. With five nights of riding, and
only two of those in sleeping cars, with a steady push in travel
and in work, it was a wearying tour. The postage of the month,
$4.55, shows the amount of correspondence kept up along the way
with the “field.”</p>

<p>In contrast with the two railroads referred to, I wish to
report that I have in hand the annual <em>half-fare</em> permits of
<em>twenty-eight</em> railroad companies in the South, nearly all that
I have occasion to use, besides an <em>annual free pass</em>, held now
for two years, on Senator Joseph E. Brown’s road from Atlanta to
Chattanooga, which I use a great deal. Having received marked and
unvarying courtesy from the officials of all of these companies
(and, indeed, from everybody South as yet, without exception), I
count it a testimony to the recognized position of the American
Missionary Association in the South that these favors have been
granted so generally and so cheerfully.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>Africa.</h4>

<p>&mdash;In South Africa, where Dr. Moffat waited years for a conversion,
there are 50,000 Christians.</p>

<p>&mdash;In almost every leading town in Egypt, from Alexandria to Assouan
on the First Cataract, mission stations have been founded by the
United Presbyterians.</p>

<p>&mdash;Four persons have offered to take up the mission work in the
field left vacant by the death of the Rev. Dr. Bushnell, of the
Gaboon, Africa.</p>

<p>&mdash;From their possessions in Algeria, the French are projecting a
trans-Sahara railroad from the Mediterranean coast to Timbuctoo, on
the Niger; and another from Senegal to the Niger. The English are
planning four other railways to the interior of Africa. If these
plans are carried out, new districts of the vast continent will be
brought within easy reach of the Christian missionary.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Mr. Arthington at a breakfast meeting in Leeds.</i>&mdash;At a
convention of the Baptist Churches in Leeds, England, the following
minute was passed unanimously: “Resolved, that this meeting, on
behalf of the Leeds Churches, pledges itself to raise a sum not
exceeding £500, which shall be employed in supplementing Mr. Robert
Arthington’s gift of £1,000 for the purchase of a steamer to be
placed on the Congo River.” Mr. Arthington himself was present, and
delivered a most interesting address on the claims of mission work
in Africa.</p>

<p>&mdash;At the Livingstonia Mission Dr. Laws has already trained one
native of the country to be a teacher among the Angoni, and has
two others in preparation. Mrs. Laws has received a sewing-machine
from Glasgow, and has taught two native girls to work it. Money has
been introduced to the country, as have also the rites of Christian
marriage.</p>

<p>&mdash;On August 22d, Archdeacon D. C. Crowther baptized 27 converts at
Bonny, in the presence of a congregation numbering no less than 842
persons. One of the candidates was Orumbi, the rich woman who has
been holding daily family worship for all her dependents.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bishop Crowther was recently visited by a wealthy chief from
Okrika, a town of 10,000 people, 40 miles from Bonny, who informed
him that his people had built a church for Christian worship, to
hold 500, which was filled every Sabbath to listen to the reading
of the service by a school boy from the Brass Mission.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Felkin has fulfilled his commission in seeing the Waganda
envoys safe to Zanzibar, and in paying a visit to Frere Town. At
the latter place, the missionaries have been instructed with regard
to runaway slaves, and the disturbances threatened recently are
likely to be avoided.</p>

<p>&mdash;There is said to be a marked difference between the tribes on
the eastern and those on the western shore of the Tanganyika Lake.
The former have neither images nor idols, while the latter have
both, in great numbers. An image is found at the entrance of every
village, and of nearly every hut. These are carved in the shape of
human figures. The art of carving exists in great perfection among
some of the tribes.</p>

<p>&mdash;R. M. Wanzer, of Hamilton, Ontario, is running his immense sewing
machine factory largely with gold received from Africa, from the
sale of more than 100,000 of his machines in that country. It
is not until we have seen orders from the agents of one great
manufacturing establishment like this, that any adequate idea is
formed of the extent to which our civilization is being introduced
into that dark continent. We may well hope that when the native
African is royally clad in long, flowing robes, made from American
prints, on American sewing machines, that he will be ready to
listen to the Gospel from the lips of him who represents these
material blessings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>The Indians.</h4>

<p>&mdash;“If you want to civilize the Indians you must keep from them
schools and churches.”</p>

<p>If you want to civilize the Indians you must keep from them
intelligence and morality.</p>

<p>If you want to civilize the Indians you must keep from them
civilization itself.</p>

<p>The first remark above was made by a somewhat celebrated scientist
at a great<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a> meeting of scientific people in Boston, last summer.
The last two we simply intended to give emphasis to the first. We
think the biggest argument that we can make against this scientific
conclusion is to say nothing about it.&mdash;<cite>Exchange.</cite></p>

<p>&mdash;On the 6th of November, the Indian school at Carlisle, Pa.,
welcomed fifteen new students: four boys and three girls from the
Menomonees at Green Bay Agency, and four boys and four girls from
the Sisseton Sioux Agency; an exceptionally bright and promising
delegation. An Apache boy, captured by the 4th Cavalry in Arizona,
six years ago, has also been admitted to the school, thus making
the total number 212.</p>

<p>&mdash;Recently, at the Cheyenne Agency, Walter Matches, one of the
Florida boys, was married to Emma, formerly a scholar at the
boarding-school. The teachers of the school, where the wedding took
place, prepared an entertainment to which all the Florida boys
were invited, and the occasion is described as having been a very
pleasant one. The newly married couple are to live at the school,
where they are both employed, and we wish for them a life of great
happiness to themselves and usefulness to their people.</p>

<p>&mdash;On the 6th day of October, the Carlisle Indian Training School
completed the first year of its history. At a little impromptu
gathering of the school and its teachers and helpers, on the
evening of that day, the children were asked to vote for, or
against, continuing the school work. Every hand went up in favor
of continuing it, and some of the boys even stood up and held up
both hands. Speeches were in order. Everybody was happy and many
reminiscences were brought out with much incentive to continued
effort.</p>

<p>&mdash;That a great wrong has been done the Poncas, all parties agree.
Who is responsible for this wrong is not at present so important
as the question whether as Bright Eyes asserts, and the Boston
Committee believe, a still greater wrong is attempted in the effort
now making to have them relinquish their title to their own homes
in Dakota on the false pretence that it is their own desire to
do so. That the Hon. Carl Schurz, so far from being a friend of
the Indian, is the most unscrupulous enemy he has ever had, we
shall believe only when the proof is overwhelming. The delegation
which has gone out to investigate, goes with some very decided
convictions on this subject, but its report, whether favorable or
adverse, will doubtless be accepted as just to all concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>The Chinese.</h4>

<p>&mdash;Our Chinese brethren on the Pacific coast have organized a
society called the “Congregational Association of Christian
Chinese.” They have a General Association and several branch
Societies. Mr. Jee Gam, the Secretary, reports the following
interesting facts and figures:</p>

<p>The Central has 107 members, of whom 11 were received, and 11 have
been baptized, the past year. Six are now absent in China. Total
contributions, $265.55.</p>

<p>Bethany Branch, San Francisco, has 23 members, of whom 6 were
received the past year, and 4 baptized. One member expelled.
Contributions, $112.00.</p>

<p>Marysville&mdash;Eleven members; all received the past year. Two have
been expelled. Contributions, $98.00.</p>

<p>Oakland&mdash;Thirty-two members; 2 received, and 2 expelled the past
year. One baptized. Three gone to China. Contributions, $643.25.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></p>

<p>Oroville&mdash;Six members, all added the past year. Contributions not
known.</p>

<p>Petaluma&mdash;Two members, of whom one has recently been received.
Contributions not known.</p>

<p>Sacramento&mdash;Thirty-two members; of whom 9 have been received, 5
expelled, and 7 baptized, during the year. Two have gone to China.
Contributions, $225.35.</p>

<p>Stockton&mdash;Nine members; 3 received, 2 expelled and 1 baptized
during the year. Contributions, $157.25.</p>

<p>Besides the contributions noted above, a general collection has
been taken, amounting to $137.50. In the effort to free Bethany
Church, San Francisco, of debt, the Chinese members and friends
of that church contributed $212.50&mdash;of which $30.50 given in
Sacramento, and $13.00 in Stockton, are included in the amounts
given above.</p>

<p>The total of gifts and offerings by the Chinese connected with our
Mission daring the past year cannot be less than $1,957.40. The
total membership, as above reported, is 222. Added the past year,
38. Baptized (including 2 at Santa Barbara), 26. Expelled, 10.</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hampton, Va.</span>&mdash;Twelve students united with the church on
the 1st Sabbath of January, nearly all of them on profession of
faith. Seven of these were Dakota Indians. It was a beautiful sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>&mdash;The Lincoln Mission of this city has
blossomed into the Lincoln Memorial Church, which was organized
by council on the 10th of January with Rev. S. P. Smith installed
at the same time as pastor. The sermon was preached by Dr. Roy,
Field Superintendent, and the other parts were by Dr. Patton,
Dr. Chickering, Dr. Rankin, Rev. Mr. Grimke, of the Colored
Presbyterian Church, Rev. T. J. Holmes, of Baltimore, and Prof.
Fairfield. Music by the organist of Dr. Rankin’s church and his
superb choir.</p>

<p>Mrs. Babcock, of Newburyport, Mass., has commenced missionary labor
with this church with every prospect of wide usefulness. She is
supported by the W. H. M. A., of Boston, under commission of the
A. M. A. This mission, in its Sunday-school work, runs back to the
day of the Nation’s martyr, whose name it bears. It has done a vast
deal of good, which has been garnered up in other churches round
about, and now it turns to care for its own. It has been sustained,
as it is now, mainly by Dr. Rankin’s people. The colored population
of the district is 60,000, with only 3,000 outside of the city. The
National Capital carries its share of the “wards.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Augusta, Ga.</span>&mdash;Some of the colored people drew off from
one of the large churches to form a new one, and have been taking
monthly collections to build a church edifice. A little girl
six years old said she must have a nickel, for next Sunday was
“throwing in” Sunday, and she wanted to see that church built. Her
mother said she shouldn’t give her one, for she spent the last
for candy and she ought to have saved that. So she went off with
a basket on her arm, picked up bones and sold them for the five
cents. Then a friend gave her another and she remarked: “I believe
I’ll put this in, too, for <em>that church must be built</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macon, Ga.</span>&mdash;There seems to be a growing spirit of harmony
among the members. The Sunday-school has had an average attendance
of 116, and is in a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a> good state of efficiency and progress. It
had a very successful Christmas concert and “fruit tree,” and its
other occasional concerts have been interesting. Mr. and Mrs.
Lathrop have done as much missionary work as they could, and have
distributed quantities of clothing, etc., to the poor, among whom
there has been much real suffering from the severe weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atlanta, Ga.</span>&mdash;It is refreshing to one’s soul to get into
a live prayer-meeting like ours last night. One good brother said,
“This thing what you call Christianity is no small thing. It starts
small, but it grows and grows and grows till it reaches out of
this world into the land we call Heaven.” Another faithful brother
always prays much, and especially for our school, and in his
remarks last evening gave as his opinion&mdash;“If ’twan’t for what’s
ben done on this yere block this city would be ten times worser’n
it is in ignorance ’n superstition. I hain’t no chillun o’ my own
and I dunno much about dealin’s with chillun, but I know dealin’s
with chillun ain’t no funny thing.” This evidently showed his
appreciation of our labor, and our hearts echoed his sentiments,
while we smiled at his quaintness and originality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selma, Ala.</span>&mdash;The school is larger at this time than it has
ever been during the same months since my connection with it. The
enrolment for the present month is 339. We have this year quite
a number of young men in attendance, from our own and adjoining
counties. A course of lectures, intended mainly for the parents
of the scholars, has been determined upon, and two lectures have
been delivered by the pastors of the Methodist and Baptist churches
respectively. Others are purposed for each month of the school year.</p>

<p>On Friday evening, 31st inst., there was a re-union of the Church.
The first hour was spent in preparatory exercises, for the coming
Communion service, after which greetings by letter were read by
the pastor and others, from those who had been connected with the
church as pastors, and absent sisters and brothers, all showing
a deep interest in the welfare and growth of the church. Then
followed remarks from those present, who had come from other States
and from Talladega College, giving us a description of their work
in the day and Sunday-schools, showing how much they appreciate the
advantages they have received and enjoyed, and are anxious to help
raise others to the same standard in spiritual and intellectual
advancement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montgomery, Ala.</span>&mdash;This is a week of prayer and we are
observing it. While the weather has thus far been very unfavorable,
afternoon meetings have been excellent; though not large as to
number, the spirit of them has been very encouraging. We are
laboring and praying for a “quickening.” I think quite a number are
seriously thoughtful. We expected to receive two last Sabbath on
profession, but the terrible cold and snows of the week prevented
us from having our church preparatory service on Wednesday evening.
There has been a very decided advance in intelligent appreciation
of the Gospel and in spirituality, within the past year, although
no real increase in numbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span>&mdash;The religious interest in the school has
brought great blessing and refreshing. On Thursday and Friday ten
students were led to give clear, whole-hearted testimony to an
entire change of heart and life. The school is moved through and
through. Scarcely a pupil of any age but is anxiously inquiring,
as are many of their friends outside. Some wonderful scenes and
experiences are given us and the entire work goes on most quietly,
and, we trust, thoroughly. We pray for the <em>whole school</em>.</p>

<h4>A Christmas Offering.</h4>

<p>The Sunday-school of the church in Marietta, Ga.&mdash;Rev. E. J.
Penney, pastor&mdash;has sent forward a Christmas offering of four
dollars, accompanied by the following letter, written by one of the
little scholars. One boy picked cotton to earn his dime. One girl
darned stockings for a gentleman to raise her part. We are much
pleased with the gratitude expressed for the aid furnished by this
Association in securing the new church:</p>

<p>Mr. Penny, dear sir, we have a nice little church in which we
have a splendid Sabbath school, and we have 5 classes my sister
is one of the teachers, myself and three little brothers attend
the Sunday school and like it very much and we have had three
very nice concerts which we injoyd very much, and we have a very
nice pastor and we all love him very much because he is so good
and kind, and we turn many thanks to that kind and benevolent
socitey who assisted us in building our nice little church and we
as Sunday school scolars wishes to mak that socitey a christmas
presant which will be the sum of 4 dollars and we would like to
do more but we are young and weak but we hope by the help of the
lord to be strong some day.</p>

<h4>Beach Institute.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MISS G. HUNTER, SAVANNAH.</p>

<p>We are receiving letters from our Northern friends inquiring if we
are asleep in Savannah. We repudiate the idea&mdash;we are fully wide
awake, although our work has not been represented recently in the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.</p>

<p>The weather and sickness prospectus at the beginning of the year
promised to be very disastrous to our missionary labors here. Since
our return it has rained almost consecutively for three months.
Notwithstanding the unusual cold and rain, our school record shows
a larger attendance at the Beach Institute than last year.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></p>

<p>It is astonishing to us teachers who come from the North, where the
children are sent to school clad in rubber clothing in inclement
weather, to see these boys and girls, so ill fitted to brave the
rain and cold, prompt and punctual in their attendance at the daily
sessions. In my department 70 boys and girls meet daily for secular
and religious instruction. Several of these children live at a
distance of from three to six miles, remaining without luncheon,
perhaps after an indifferent breakfast, the entire session. Every
day I see new proofs of appreciation in the parents and children:
they are beginning to realize the strenuous efforts of missionary
labor for their future prosperity and eternal salvation. What
more encouragement can we desire&mdash;looking into their eager faces
all aglow, and seeing the quiet submission at the lack of even
the necessary daily comforts that they may feed this great hungry
desire for knowledge?</p>

<p>We have a weekly Bible meeting held every Monday afternoon
immediately after school, in the Principal’s room, conducted by
Miss Douglass. The children are interested and the attendance is
large. With the Bible in one hand and the text-book in the other,
we hope grand results for the next generation of the colored race.
Also we have a woman’s weekly prayer-meeting held at various
houses. Would I could take my readers with me to these little
gatherings of sincere, earnest women, praying for the salvation of
their fellow-people; singing “hallelujah” for that freedom from sin
worse than the bondage of slavery. The church work is progressing
under our minister. These people very quickly discover when the
Gospel is preached in an able and sincere manner, and are attentive
listeners, worshiping the Lord in a subdued and quiet way; a strong
contrast to their former modes and habits. We are preparing a list
of the names and residences of the Beach pupils for Miss Douglass,
who intends visiting the parents in a friendly and religious call.
The extreme cold and distress, to a people unprepared for it, call
upon us for extra exertions. Miss Douglass distributes donations
judiciously, and thoroughly inquires into the needs of the
recipients. Pray that the Lord will continue the blessing of life
and health, that we may toil on in faith and patience.</p>

<h4>Missionary Work in Selma.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MISS MARY K. LUNT.</p>

<p>I find my work constantly increasing; indeed there is no limit,
only a lack of time and strength. Really, there is work enough for
two or three more, whose whole attention can be given to it. I am
happy to say that some of our colored sisters are able to give us
considerable help in missionary work, and we feel confident that
more aid from the younger ones may be expected.</p>

<p>We have formed a society called “The Mission Workers,” the object
of which is to awaken a greater interest in home and foreign
missions. The proceeds of a sale which we are to have at Christmas
will be devoted to this purpose.</p>

<p>Since beginning work in the fall I have called on one hundred and
thirty-three families. When convenient, as in most cases, I have
read the Bible and tracts or papers to the women, also offering
prayer with them; have established a weekly prayer-meeting for the
women, some distance from the Home; also one weekly in my room, in
which white and colored lead by turns. They are precious seasons
to us all, and we feel that a blessing is for us. Several of our
members, whose husbands are unconverted, meet in their homes to
pray for their conversion. Friends frequently present requests for
prayers.</p>

<p>I have also quite a large class of married women and one young
man,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a> reciting to me, in the afternoon, in the various branches of
common school studies, and could have a much larger class were I to
open a night school, but I dare not undertake that, my time is so
fully occupied during the day.</p>

<h3>LOUISIANA.</h3>

<h4>Revival in Central Church&mdash;English Evangelists.</h4>

<p class="secauth">W. S. ALEXANDER, D. D., NEW ORLEANS.</p>

<p>In my last letter the hope was expressed that we might have good
tidings to send you. God has graciously and marvelously answered
our prayer.</p>

<p>The month of November was a blessed month in Central Church.</p>

<p>The week of prayer in January has in other years been the beginning
of real, earnest revival effort. The revival seasons of blessed
memory have dated from this holy week. But the coming of two
English Evangelists, James Wharton and Richard Irving, during the
last days of October, called for immediate action, and we decided
at once to open revival meetings, and to engage in a united and
earnest effort for the salvation of sinners.</p>

<p>While these dear brethren were resting from their voyage, the
church came together and re-consecrated themselves to God. There
was a quick and deep apprehension of the necessity of personal
holiness and of self-denying service for Christ. Indeed the entire
month of October had been a month of prayerful preparation for the
movement. Printed notices were widely distributed, and Christians
went from house to house and invited people to come and seek the
salvation of their souls. From the opening night the meetings were
marked by deep seriousness and the evident presence of the Divine
Spirit. The method of the Evangelists was simple and honest. No
artificial means for exciting emotion were used. The Gospel was
preached in its simplicity, its purity, and its power. The sermons
were heart-searching, faithful and tender. The law in its exactions
and the Gospel in its provisions and promises, were presented
night after night. Brother Irving stayed with us ten days, and
Brother Wharton three weeks. After the sermon the Pastor took
charge of the meetings, and called the inquirers to the “mourners’
seats.” Special appeals and prayers were offered. Inquirers were
directed one by one how to find the Saviour, and to obtain peace
in believing. At some meetings Christians were permitted and
encouraged to speak of the love and preciousness of Jesus; and such
a volume of testimony! We could truly say, “Lord, it is good for
us to be here.” As I recall the sheaves that were gathered in this
glorious harvest I find much to thank God for. In two instances
both the husband and wife&mdash;all young people&mdash;were converted, and
standing side by side took the vows of the church upon them. Women
who had struggled with manifold temptations, and around whom the
wildest storms of sorrow had gathered, found in Christ a refuge
from the storm and the tempest. Young men with the hopes and
possibilities of Christian manhood before them, humbly, heartily,
and I believe, forever, took their position as the disciples of the
Son of God. When Brother Wharton was compelled to leave us to meet
an engagement in another church, the Pastor continued the meetings
for another week, assisted by Rev. A. N. Wyckoff, of the Canal St.
Presb. Church, Rev. Dr. John Matthews, of the M. E. Church, and two
able colored preachers. The fire burned brightly to the last.</p>

<p>The first Sabbath in December, thirty-one were received to
the Central Church on profession of their faith in Christ. We
hope forty-eight were converted in this revival. Some joined
other churches and more will yet unite themselves with us. The
meetings were thronged as never before. Crowds of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a> young men
attended constantly. Some of them were won for God&mdash;others were
impressed&mdash;and with very many, let us hope and pray, the truth they
heard and the scenes they witnessed will prove to be “bread cast
upon the waters,” to be gathered in some future day to the glory of
God.</p>

<p>I think I see a quickened and deepened consciousness of right as
they read it in the light of His word, upon the part of professing
Christians a painful and unyielding anxiety with those who have not
submitted their hearts to God, and with many, a sincere longing to
come into the fellowship of the Gospel. If this judgment be true,
then how great things has the dear Lord done for us!</p>

<p>The Church now numbers 210 members. My impartial judgment is
that they represent a good deal of vitality, and are beginning
to realize the infinite willingness of God to bless them, and to
enlarge their borders.</p>

<h3>TENNESSEE.</h3>

<h4>Methods of Revival Work at Fisk University.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. A. K. SPENCE, NASHVILLE.</p>

<p>You request me to give an idea of our “methods, success, and
experiences” in revival work in Fisk University. It is with much
hesitation that I attempt to comply with your wish, for it is
difficult, in a brief communication, to convey a correct idea
in such matters, and, also, one shrinks from bringing into the
foreground human agencies in a work which, if genuine, must be
Divine.</p>

<p>To understand revival work here, one must know the ordinary
religious work done in the University. Varying from time to time,
the following are the means of grace enjoyed by us. We have a
church which is, practically, a part of the school. There are three
services on the Sabbath&mdash;a preaching service, a Sunday-school, and
a prayer meeting. During the week there are school devotions in the
morning and family devotions in the evening, and also one meeting
for prayer. Upon all these attendance is required.</p>

<p>Many other meetings are held voluntarily by the students, conducted
frequently by an instructor. There is a Christian Association of
the young men and one of the young women, meeting once a week,
or oftener. The Society for the Evangelization of Africa holds a
meeting once a month, and every Sunday morning since the departure
of our missionaries to Africa, a meeting has been held to pray for
them and their cause.</p>

<p>Besides these stated meetings, there is a large amount of personal
religious work done in a private way, to lead the unconverted
to Christ. Opportunities are sought for conversation and prayer
with individuals alone. As employees of the American Missionary
Association, we feel ourselves bound to labor, as we can, for the
salvation of our students. We try to keep it before us continually
that we should aim at nothing less than their conversion. And we
seek to impress it upon all, that the Institution is entirely the
Lord’s, built with His money, kept by His care, and dedicated to
His service. We are sustained by the charities of God’s people,
given for the sake of His cause. We remember the way in which our
wants have been met, in the use of the Jubilee Singers and by other
means. The place whereon we stand is holy ground.</p>

<p>In “times of refreshing” the ordinary means of grace have been
quickened into greater life, and other means have been used as the
Spirit of God seemed to direct. The morning and evening devotions
have at times been turned into revival meetings, and extra meetings
for prayer and labor with inquirers have been instituted. In a few
cases the work of the school has been suspended and the day given
to religious meetings; but usually the ordinary work has gone on.
Persons under too deep conviction to attend to aught else, have<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a>
been allowed and advised to wait upon God, and suitable persons
have been permitted to wait with them. Occasionally scenes have
transpired not to be forgotten nor to be described&mdash;the tears,
the sighs, the groans, the bowed or prostrate form&mdash;and the after
unspeakable joy! As time has gone on, whether for better or worse,
the emotional has diminished. We have never sought to produce
excitement, nor have we sought rudely to crush it out when it came
spontaneously, but to quiet it off by indirect means, a thing
always soon successful. Doubtless clearer views of truth are doing
away with that frenzy of religious excitement which has so largely
prevailed, unbalancing the reason and prostrating the body.</p>

<p>We find it necessary to follow a revival with oft-repeated
instructions as to the doctrines and duties of Christianity. The
young converts need much loving and wise watchcare. They are
exposed to many dangers, and have nearly everything to learn,
except that they are the Lord’s and he is theirs.</p>

<p>Some years in the history of Fisk University have been years
of great barrenness in spiritual things, but none of entire
unfruitfulness. Yet long and sorely have we been made to cry unto
God, and humble ourselves before Him. Other years are precious in
our memories because of God’s peculiar presence there. Three are
especially so, 1870, 1873, and 1876; but space will not permit us
to enter upon them. Books might be written about them, but they are
recorded in God’s book of remembrance; there let them remain. Oh,
for a mighty and continual baptism of the Holy Ghost on all our
schools in the South!</p>

<h4>Sanitary Reform&mdash;Business&mdash;Industrial Instruction&mdash;Lecture
Course&mdash;Revival.</h4>

<p class="secauth">PROF. A. J. STEELE, MEMPHIS.</p>

<p>Great is sanitary reform, at least so say all good Memphians.
The Memphis of last November is not the Memphis of this, except
in muddy and broken streets and shabby street cars drawn by more
shabby mules. For these, “men may come and men may go, but they go
on forever.”</p>

<p>The business season opened in October, hopefully and more brisk
than ever before, notwithstanding that our population has within
the three years dropped from fifty to thirty-five thousand.</p>

<p>Merchants are reaping a rich harvest, and all kinds of labor find
employment and fair pay, interrupted somewhat for the past month by
severe cold and continued rains, which have also seriously damaged
the ungathered cotton crop. What would you say to <em>ninety inches</em>
rainfall in <em>eleven</em> months? This is the amount reported by the
signal service observer at Vicksburg for this year up to December 1.</p>

<p>No one now thinks of Memphis as a failure; what with a unique and
almost perfect system of sewerage nearly completed, and what with
a growing wholesale trade and many permanent improvements, both
public and private, a new Memphis, indeed, must soon replace the
old.</p>

<p>School opened in October with a full attendance and every promise
of a most successful year. Our rooms for industrial instruction are
now finished and ready for use. The classes in needlework, etc.,
are organized, and in January a class or classes in cooking will
receive regular instruction, with practice in the experimental
kitchen.</p>

<p>Instruction will also be given to a class in the care of the sick.
It is a fact that the great majority of our pupils must continue
in very humble positions and circumstances; our aim must be to fit
them to fill well the lots that must fall to them in life; and
whatever positions they may fill, they must know how to build up,
and even adorn, homes that shall be very different from those their
parents have known.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></p>

<p>The proverb runs, “A man far from home is near to danger.” The most
direct way, certainly, of bringing better things to these people,
and to the South, is through the home.</p>

<p>Our lecture course for this year is about made up. Dr. Magoun,
while here in attendance upon the conference and to visit his
daughter, our music teacher, gave the first lecture in this year’s
course. Among others to speak are Rev. Dr. Max Samfield, Jewish
Rabbi; Rev. Mr. Mayo, of Boston; Judge Pierce of the Circuit Court,
two physicians and other prominent professional and business men
here. Our idea is to have all the lectures, as far as possible,
deal with practical matters, in some degree according with our
regular industrial work. In the past four weeks we have been
greatly blessed by the Spirit’s presence with us, over thirty
of our pupils having found the “better way,” we trust. With the
exception of one or two sitting-room meetings, we have only held a
half-hour prayer meeting each day directly after school. Some of
the conversions have come with wonderful power and presence of the
Spirit, but all with quietness and assurance. We hope for still
more, and we are glad to have before us so much of the year with
its opportunities for training these “lambs” in the Christian life.
Most of them go with their parents and friends to the old churches,
where, too often, the weekly or occasional emotional outburst or
religious frenzy takes the place of real Christian growth and
experience. A number will join our church, two or three even
breaking away from friends and parents to find a more intelligent,
helpful church connection.</p>

<p>Dear friend I would like write to you and tell you all about
myself. I don’t known any thing when I first came to school,
because I never school at my own home. and I like going to school
at Hampton better than my own home.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a> because I learn here more
then my own home. And I like to work. if I learn how to work,
when I go home. I think I must help some other Indians that dont
know any thing about the white mans way or about Gods word, and
I think that is best way to teach each other. and I known how
to write. but I dont known how to read yet. I know how to talk
englist but not much. And we are work every afternoon. so we like
it very well. and school every morning. and we like it to learn
a good way. We dont want be a bad man. because if we are bad God
would not like that kind of man. so we want be a good. and we
learn the white mans way now and we were past the Indians way
about too years ago. and we take the new way. All the Indians boy
and gurls very well. and doing well. and we had very pleasant
time last summer over Shell Banks. we had work out there and when
we done our work we used play out there. I wish to work out there
a gain next summer. I heard that them Indians at my home learn
some thing now. they don’t try to learn befor I come here, and I
am very glad that they try to learn some thing now. and I wish
that the Indian boys and girls come here to school and learn some
thing for their people. now our lesson in Arithmetic and reader.
and English too. and I like to study them very much. and I been
here two years. so I learn some thing now. but not much. and some
of the Indian boys went over Mass last summer and went back here
again last oct. and they told us that the white people are good.
because they are kind to the Indian boys and girls. that is all I
have to say to you from your friend</p>

<h3>HOW SPEEDS THE WORK?</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p><i>The Marysville Mission</i>, being viewed as no longer an experiment,
celebrated its first anniversary on Nov. 21st, at the Presbyterian
Church in that city. Its spacious and beautiful auditorium was
crowded, the Methodist congregation uniting in the services.
The exercises were very simple, consisting of recitations of
Scripture, singing, and an address by our helper, Lee Sam. But
the interest rose as the service moved on, till after a specially
excellent recitation of I Cor., 13th chap., and especially after
Lee Sam’s address, it burst forth in applause. At almost all our
anniversaries, held though they are in churches and on Sunday
evenings, this expression of interest takes place, unsought,
unexpected, undesired, but showing in a gratifying way that
whatever hard things men may say of a class of people, as a class,
of a race as a race, in the abstract, yet bring them face to
face with individuals of that class or race, trying to improve
themselves, struggling upwards toward intelligence and freedom and
Christianity, and they cannot refuse them the tribute of their
good will, their cheery God-speed. There were Congressmen in the
olden times who voted<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a> for the Fugitive Slave Law, and orators who
defended it before the people, who could not possibly have helped
wishing success to any individual fugitive if they actually saw him
making for liberty with his eye on the north star, and even giving
the poor fellow a sly lift that way if they had an opportunity. A
warm heart is too strong for a wrong head under such circumstances.
And so our anti-Chinese friends at Marysville gave us their
presence at our Anniversary, curious to see what could be done,
and before we were through bade us God-speed and helped us with a
generous contribution. On the day following, a well-officered local
auxiliary, like those at Sacramento, Stockton, Petaluma and Los
Angeles, was organized. The school is now established in permanent
quarters, furnished with all that is indispensable to a comfortable
mission house, and sets forth on its second year with promise of
good work and glad harvests.</p>

<p><i>New Schools.</i>&mdash;In this month of December, in which I am writing,
we have thirteen schools in operation, a larger number than ever
before. The Oroville school resumed its sessions December 1st under
the care of Miss Helen Ostrom, whose father, once a missionary at
Amoy, China, has taken pastoral charge of the Congregational Church
in that place. It starts well, and engages the interest not only
of the Chinese, but also of the better element among the Christian
people of that town, to a greater degree, I believe, than ever
before.</p>

<p>Of the two new schools, one is in Oakland, occupying an apartment
kindly granted for the purpose by the Pacific Theological Seminary,
situated about 1¼ miles from the school already sustained in
rooms supplied by the First Congregational Church. It is near the
Plymouth Avenue Church, and will, we trust, be taken under its
wing. Miss Maria W. Bye is its faithful and devoted teacher. The
other new school is at Point Pedro, the Chinese fishing village of
which some account was given in the December <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.
On visiting the place I found it to consist of six or seven
distinct villages situated on the shore of little coves, and
separated from each other by points of greater or less altitude
jutting out boldly into the Bay. The population, estimated at about
600, is thus divided into little groups of, say, 100 people each;
the distance from the nearest to the most remote being not less
than two miles. It calls for <em>two</em> schools, and affording, as it
does, a field for missionary service among women and children as
well as men, it needs at least one teacher able to give not only
evenings, but the daytime also to the work. We are at present
feeling our way under conditions quite different from those in
any of our older schools, praying that the wisdom from above may
save us from the mistakes into which our own unaided counsel would
plunge us certainly; and that, as we learn how to reach these dark
and scattered multitudes, we may have means adequate to the task.
“As thy days so shall thy strength be.”</p>

<p><i>The Money Question.</i>&mdash;Many who count themselves specially prudent
find no room for the exercise of faith in matters of cash. But I
have not so read either the word or the providence of God. We are
walking by faith in laying out our missionary work for this new
year. In place of the $1,610.70 received last year over and above
the regular appropriation from the treasury in New York, we rely
upon raising $5,000 this year. We cannot do the work waiting to be
done, we cannot answer the Master’s call with any less sum than
that. Every cent of it can be used without extravagance. Indeed we
can practice a more effective economy on an income of $10,000 per
annum than on one of $7,600. A certain amount is necessary even
to <em>start</em>. There are some heavy expenses from which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a> there is no
escape however we may cut down the work, unless, indeed, we cut its
life out altogether. These would not be materially increased even
though the service rendered were increased three-fold. We look,
therefore, first to the Master himself, and then to his people,
whom he constitutes his almoners, to make up this $5,000. Humbly
trusting to his faithfulness, we expect it to come, and we venture
forward on that expectation. Already, from a helper in the “far
East” comes an unsolicited gift of $100, and a pledge of another
$100 if, thereby, this $5,000 can be secured. Already I seem to
see in the near future full twenty-five or even many more of such
$100 shares taken. Where shall I find the remainder? Are there no
readers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> who can aid me to answer this
question? “Inasmuch as ye have done it even to one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</p>

<h3>BILL AND ANDY’S LARK.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MRS. HARRIET A. CHEEVER</p>

<p>“I say, Andy! let’s go hear Sam Andrews talk to-night; doesn’t cost
anything to go in, but they take a c’llection after he’s through,
so we can put ten cents in the box, and after meetin’ we can buy
some nuts and candy, and have quite a little lark; come on, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Sam Andrews!” said Andy, “what, that colored boy that’s been off
to the sem’nary?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they say he talks splendid.”</p>

<p>“How much money you got?” queried Andy.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents,” answered Bill. “I’ll take forty cents along
to-night&mdash;earned it all, you know, so it’s mine to do what I please
with; I’ll put ten cents in the box,&mdash;oughter help Sam a little,
you know,&mdash;then I’ll spend, say twenty cents for goodies, and have
ten cents in my pocket, and leave ten cents at home; must save a
little, you know; how much you got?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got fifty cents too;” said Andy. “Yes, I’ll go. Father won’t
object to my goin’ to hear Sam, and of course we won’t stay out
very late.”</p>

<p>Bill and Andy were boy chums, who at the present speaking were
roosting on a picket fence, in that seemingly comfortable manner
in which bipeds of their species seem perfectly capable of doing.
They were good-hearted, industrious boys, but rather thoughtless at
times, and the parents of both often felt troubled that they seemed
to care so little for “book learning.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the Town Hall was filling with a half interested,
half curious audience to hear Sam Andrew’s story, among the rest,
on the back seats, sat Bill and Andy.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Sam began; he told how, through struggles and
hardships, want and poverty, he had persisted in gaining an
entrance into the seminary.</p>

<p>All at once, Bill swallowed hard, then whispered to his companion,</p>

<p>“I say, Andy, let’s give Sam twenty cents instead of ten!”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s,” readily agreed Andy.</p>

<p>Sam went on; he told how fever broke out among some of the seminary
boys, and he and a few others spent the last cent they could raise
in getting medicines, and alas! a coffin in more than one case.</p>

<p>This time Bill gulped down a great sob, and whispered brokenly,</p>

<p>“Andy, old boy, let’s make it thirty cents; a heart of stone
couldn’t stan’ that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so we will,” gasped Andy, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Sam continued: he told of selling the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a> coat off his back, sooner
than give up his precious opportunities for studying and improving
his mind.</p>

<p>Here Bill gave Andy a nudge, and whispered desperately,</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ the whole forty, Andy; what’s a selfish old lark of nuts
and candy, I’d like to know, for a well fed cove like me? I’ll help
Sam the whole figger,&mdash;cookies if I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Feel as if I’d been a pig all my life,” whimpered Andy, as Sam
went on with his piteous story of painful perseverance and hard
endurance. All at once Bill began edging off the settee, but he
stopped to whisper again,</p>

<p>“Say, Andy, I’m going home as tight as ever I can leg it after that
other ten cents; be back in a minute;” and before Andy could reply
he was off: in a few moments he was back again, but where was Andy?</p>

<p>A moment later Andy entered softly, and taking his seat by Bill,
opened his hand, in which was <em>his</em> last ten cent piece.</p>

<p>But it might have done one real good to have seen the peculiar
shine in the eyes of the generous boys, as their willing offerings
rattled down into the well-filled box which was passed around for
the collection at the close of the meeting.</p>

<p>And after all, that was not the best of it, for on the way home,
instead of the “selfish lark” so cheerfully given up, the boys had
a good sensible talk, in which they agreed that it was shameful,
the way in which they had neglected their studies, and here was a
poor colored boy, who had suffered “all a feller <em>could</em> suffer and
pull through,”&mdash;as Andy remarked with boy-like earnestness,&mdash;for
the knowledge they, in their favored freedom from care and
privation, had hardly thought worth possessing, much less toiling
for.</p>

<p>Bill and Andy’s parents silently wondered what had come over their
boys, that all at once they grew so thoughtful and studious; but
the boys knew what had come over them, and they also knew why it
was that whenever they earned any money, a part was saved out from
the rest for charitable purposes.</p>

<p>“Makes a feller feel quite like a man to help some one else along a
little besides himself, doesn’t it Bill, old boy?” Andy asked one
day.</p>

<p>And Bill replied,</p>

<p>“Guess it does! We can’t do much, but even our little is worth
givin’, ’specially when a cove saves it himself: guess our
Sunday-school teacher was right; let’s see, what was that verse
she said?&mdash;‘It is more blesseder to&mdash;to give away a part, than to
receive all inter yourself,’&mdash;I believe that was about it, and <em>so</em>
much better than wastin’ it on a senseless lark!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called “<span class="smcap">The American
Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to
conduct Christian missionary and educational operations, and
diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and
urgent fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who
professes faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slaveholder,
or in the practice of other immoralities, and who contributes to
the funds, may become a member of the Society; and by the payment
of thirty dollars, a life member; provided that children and others
who have not professed their faith may be constituted life members
without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet annually, in the month of
September, October or November, for the election of officers and
the transaction of other business, at such time and place as shall
be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be constituted of
the regular officers and members of the Society at the time of
such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled
to one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society shall be a President,
Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries,
Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive Committee of not less
than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be
advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio, members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the
collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing, counselling,
sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient reasons)
missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject
always to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a
reference mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any
aggrieved agent or missionary; and the decision of such reference
shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call,
in all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and
general conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the
diffusion of the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous
promotion of the missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting funds, in
appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in selecting
fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will endeavor
particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive the
known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or individuals
agreeing to the principles of this Society, and wishing to appoint
and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do so
through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution
without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at a
regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment has been
submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee in
season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTE:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among
others, a belief in the guilty and lost condition of all men
without a Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning
Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of the world; the
necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith and
holy obedience in order to salvation; the immortality of the soul;
and the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of
the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p>

<h2>The American Missionary Association.</h2>


<hr class="chap" />


<h3>AIM AND WORK.</h3>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted
its main efforts to preparing the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their
duties as citizens and Christians in America and as missionaries
in Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the
caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate
with the Government in its humane and Christian policy towards the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>


<h3>STATISTICS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Churches</span>: <i>In the South</i>&mdash;In Va., 1; N. C., 6; S. C., 2;
Ga., 13; Ky., 6; Tenn., 4; Ala., 14; La., 17; Miss., 4; Texas, 6.
<i>Africa</i>, 2. <i>Among the Indians</i>, 1. Total 76.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Institutions Founded, Fostered or Sustained in the
South.</span>&mdash;<i>Chartered</i>: Hampton, Va.; Berea, Ky.; Talladega,
Ala.; Atlanta, Ga.; Nashville, Tenn.; Tougaloo, Miss.; New
Orleans, La.; and Austin, Texas, 8. <i>Graded or Normal Schools</i>: at
Wilmington, Raleigh, N. C.; Charleston, Greenwood, S. C.; Savannah,
Macon, Atlanta, Ga.; Montgomery, Mobile, Athens, Selma, Ala.;
Memphis, Tenn., 12. <i>Other Schools</i>, 31. Total 51.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teachers, Missionaries and Assistants.</span>&mdash;Among the
Freedmen, 284; among the Chinese, 22; among the Indians, 11; in
Africa, 13. Total, 330. <span class="smcap">Students</span>&mdash;In Theology, 102; Law,
23; in College Course, 75; in other studies, 7,852. Total, 8,052.
Scholars taught by former pupils of our schools, estimated at
150,000. <span class="smcap">Indians</span> under the care of the Association, 13,000.</p>


<h3>WANTS.</h3>

<p>1. A steady <span class="medium">INCREASE</span> of regular income to keep pace with
the growing work. This increase can only be reached by <em>regular</em>
and <em>larger</em> contributions from the churches&mdash;the feeble as well as
the strong.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Additional Buildings</span> for our higher educational
institutions, to accommodate the increasing numbers of students;
<span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span> for the new churches we are organizing;
<span class="smcap">More Ministers</span>, cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as ministers here
and missionaries to Africa&mdash;a pressing want.</p>

of the testator.</p>

contributions of our intelligent missionaries and teachers in
all parts of the field, and with occasional communications from
careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the <cite>American Missionary</cite>
furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the
Freedmen as citizens in the South and as missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p class="medium">It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting
the races among which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of
current events relating to their welfare and progress.</p>

Christianizing of these despised races are asked to read it, and
assist in its circulation. Begin with the January number and the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
